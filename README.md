# Abstract
The Elliptic Curve Diffie-Hellman-Merkle Key Exchange, abbreviated ECDHKE, is a public key
exchange protocol based on the Diffie-Hellman-Merkle key exchange (DHKE) protocol. Originally
outlined by Ralph Merkle and later published by Whitfield Diffie and Martin Hellman in 1976 [4],
the DHKE is designed to allow two parties to publicly exchange information in order to securely
generate a shared cryptographic key. This key can then be used to encrypt messages using other
cryptographic systems for example RSA. The ECDHKE is a variant of the DHKE designed using
elliptic curves rather than the traditional modular arithmetic. Both the DHKE and ECDHKE
protocols are secured by the Discrete Logarithm Problem and the Diffie-Hellman Problem.
